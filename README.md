TET - is a my fork from original TPT. 

TET means The Electronics Toy.

So in this builds I'll focuse on improving simulation speed by reducing other parts of the game (as air simulation or chemical interactions). 
I'll try to keep supporting to load and save your saves in original TPT server. 
It means that any save can be uploaded or opened from TPT server, but not everyone will be working correctly.

To use online features such as saving, you need to [register an account](https://powdertoy.co.uk/Register.html).
You can also visit [the official TPT forum](https://powdertoy.co.uk/Discussions/Categories/Index.html).
